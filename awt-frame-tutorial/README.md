# AWT Frame Tutorial
### A custom code-icle by chezzwizz

My first code-icle, hopefully of many. Since I have never quite been able to get through writing and installing a personal blog, mostly due to issues surrounding dissonance related to the "eggs in a basket" issue, I have decided to publish some bits as I get the wild hair to learn them my self.

These are by no means professional or really anything better than mediocre. They are all published as an indepedndant, unverified attempt to learn through teaching. Since I have read numerous times that the most effective way to learn is to teach, and I have found that I constantly use constructs I never stop to understand or learn myself, I decided to just write and code at the same time.

Since Art and Code are pretty close in nature, I thought I'd coin the term code-icle (instead of article) as a way to to denote that the source file contins a massive amount of comments which make up the article portion, as well as the code which generates the end project. In areas where I wanted to demonstrate an alternative, but not have it compile as part of the final result, I used the single line comment style and wrote the lines as they would/could be if one were so curious as to compile it.

As a published product, I hope to make all code-icles compileable. This particular one is a super simple `java.awt.Frame` based GUI window application which walks the reader through how to make a simple `Frame` with a `java.awt.event.WindowListener` event listener internal class.

I hope this provides some enlightenment or, at the very least, entertainment for any one looking to explore AWT.

Thanks.

Chuck
